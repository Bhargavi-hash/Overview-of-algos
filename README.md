# Algorithm Overviews
This repository is created as a part of Algorithm analysis and design course project. It gives you a brief overview of different types of algorithms like greedy algorithms, dynamic programming algorithms, backtracking algorithms, recursive algorithms, sorting algorithms, searching algorithms etc.

**Time complexity** and **space complexity** of algorithms can be understood and visualized efficiently after going through the project PDF.
